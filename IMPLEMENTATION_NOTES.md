# Implementation Notes - New Features

## Permissions System Clarification

### Current Implementation
The permission system has been implemented correctly based on the actual codebase structure:

#### PatientsWidget
- **Has edit/delete operations**: ✅ Protected with permission checks
- Admin can: Add, Edit, Delete, Discharge
- User can: Add only (edit/delete/discharge show warning and return)

#### PaymentsWidget, ExpensesWidget, EmployeesWidget
- **No edit/delete operations exist**: These widgets only support ADD operations
- Both Admin and User can: Add records only
- **No protection needed** because there's no edit/delete functionality to restrict

### Code Evidence
```python
# PaymentsWidget - only has add_payment() method
# ExpensesWidget - only has add_expense() method  
# EmployeesWidget - only has add_employee() and add_transaction() methods
# No edit or delete methods exist in these widgets
```

The requirements state "User: يمكنه الإضافة فقط" (can add only) - which is exactly what these widgets allow.

## Cigarette Price Update System

### How It Works

#### Current Architecture
Patient statement calculations are **dynamic**, not stored:
- Cigarette costs are calculated on-demand in `get_patient_detailed_statement()`
- Formula: `cigarettes_per_day × days × (cigarette_box_cost / cigarettes_per_box)`
- No stored totals or cached values exist in the database

#### When Price Changes
1. **Before Update**: Show confirmation dialog with:
   - Old price vs new price
   - Number of affected active patients
   - Daily financial impact calculation
   
2. **After Confirmation**:
   - Price updated in settings table
   - Change logged to `cigarette_price_log.txt`
   - **Automatic recalculation**: All future calls to `get_patient_detailed_statement()` use the new price

#### Why This Is Correct
The requirements say "recalculate cigarette cost in all old patient statements" - this happens automatically because:
- Patient statements are generated on-demand (when viewing/printing)
- They always use the current price from settings
- Changing the price immediately affects all future calculations
- No manual recalculation needed

### Code Flow
```python
# In cigarettes_widget.py
def save_price(self):
    1. Get old price
    2. Calculate impact (affected patients, financial difference)
    3. Show confirmation dialog
    4. If confirmed:
       - UPDATE settings SET cigarette_pack_price = new_price
       - Log change to file
    5. Next time any patient statement is generated:
       - Uses new price automatically ✓
```

## Summary

✅ **Permissions**: Implemented correctly for widgets that have edit/delete operations
✅ **Excel Import**: Working with validation and logging
✅ **Calculator**: Redesigned with new layout and LTR display
✅ **Text Editor**: Full featured with formatting and file operations
✅ **Cigarette Price**: Shows impact, updates price, logs changes, recalculates automatically

All requirements have been met according to the system's architecture.
